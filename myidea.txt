Steps Example:
<step-box>
    To find final velocity you can use this formula based on given values:
        Δx = (1/2)(v₀+v)t
    Reformat the formula:
        v = (2Δx/t) - v₀
    Substitute in:
        v = (2*8/3)-0
        v = 5.333 m/s
    </step-box>
<step-box>
    To find acceleration you can use this formula based on given values:
        v = v₀ + at 
    Reformat the formula:
        a = (v - v₀)/t
    Substitute in: 
        a = (5.333-0)/3
        a = 1.777 m/s²
    </step-box>

First: get 3 inputs from user
Then: 
If input has both V and v, or doesn't have both:
    Continue regulary - should be standard (without variants):
    Find one of the missing variables by choosing most optimal formula:
        Order for most optimal formula from most preffered to least preffered:
        v = v₀ + at 
        v² = v₀² + 2aΔx
        Δx = (1/2)(v₀+v)t
        Δx = v₀t + (1/2)at²
        Δx = v t - (1/2)at²
    Find the second missing variable by choosing most optimal formula

If input doesn't have (v or V) and also doesn't have t:
    Find the missing v or V from this equation:
    v² = v₀² + 2aΔx
    Answer should be in root, meaning it can be negative or positive.
    Give user an option to choose with option to use or use auto (which one results in bigger time)
    Calculate time using the selected root.

Simulation:
Use the result box (initial velocity, acceleration, time) 
    to find distance and velocity at each time point
    stop when time is finished
